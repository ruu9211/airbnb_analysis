# 🏠 Airbnb Dashboard — Greater Toronto Area (GTA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores Airbnb listings in the **Greater Toronto Area (GTA)** through a Tableau dashboard.  
The goal was to provide meaningful insights into pricing, availability, and neighbourhood quality for short-term rentals across the GTA.

## 🎯 Why I Built This Dashboard
Earlier this year, a friend of mine was visiting Toronto from abroad and asked for advice on where to stay.  
Instead of giving broad recommendations, I decided to analyze **Airbnb listings across the GTA** and create a **dashboard** that could answer their questions directly:

- Which neighbourhoods are the most popular for Airbnbs?  
- How much should they expect to pay per bedroom?  
- Which areas are rated the highest by other visitors?  

By putting everything in one place, my friend could quickly explore options and make a decision without having to manually compare dozens of listings.
